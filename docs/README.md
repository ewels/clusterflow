# Introduction
## Cluster Flow v0.4

Cluster Flow is simple package
designed to run bioinformatics pipelines. It is operated through a single command
`cf`, which can be used to launch, configure, monitor and cancel pipelines.

When you run Cluster Flow, you choose a pipeline. This has a list of modules
in order. Each module is a wrapper around a bioinformatics tool.
When the pipeline has finished, a notification e-mail is sent to you with
status messages from the log.

## Tutorial Videos
To get you started with Cluster Flow, there are two tutorial videos available on YouTube.
These are both slightly out of date now (v0.3 CF), but the principles of how the software
works are the same. Please refer to the docs below for up to date specifics.
